# Movable Dock App
A simple app that simulates a draggable dock similar to macOS's dock.

# Features
Drag and Drop: Rearrange the dock items by dragging them and dropping them in different positions.
- The app displays a dock at the bottom of the screen with draggable items.
- Drag any item and place it on another position in the dock. The item will smoothly animate to the new location.
- You can also move the dock items around freely while interacting with the interface.

# Run It in DartPad
You can copy and paste the code into DartPad and hit "Run". Make sure to select Flutter on the left panel.

>DartPad supports Flutter, but only single-file apps â€” this app is fully compatible.
